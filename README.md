## Approach
The solution combined the following techniques:
1. **Machine Learning (LayoutLMv2)**: Fine-tuned the LayoutLMv2 model for text classification in graph images, identifying key elements like titles, axes, and legends.
2. **Contour Detection**: Applied computer vision techniques to detect bars and other graph components for data extraction.
3. **Rule-based Methods**: Developed a rule-based approach to categorize graph data based on layout and structure.

## Repository Contents
- **Code**: The code for fine-tuning the LayoutLMv2 model and performing contour detection.
- **Dataset**: A labeled dataset of graph images used for training the model (included in the repository).
- **Blog Post**: A step-by-step breakdown of the solution, approaches used, and challenges overcome during the development.
